    "topic": "Jellyfish Biological Immortality",
    "summary": "Some jellyfish, particularly the Turritopsis dohrnii (immortal jellyfish), possess a unique biological mechanism that allows them to essentially reverse aging. When stressed or damaged, these jellyfish can revert to their juvenile polyp stage, effectively resetting their biological clock. This process, called transdifferentiation, enables them to potentially live indefinitely, not by stopping aging, but by continuously regenerating themselves. Biological immortality means they do not die from natural cellular breakdown, though they can still be killed by external factors like predation or environmental damage.",
